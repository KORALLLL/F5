# F5: microbudget training

**F5-TTS**: Diffusion Transformer with ConvNeXt V2, faster trained and inference.


**Sway Sampling**: Inference-time flow step sampling strategy, greatly improves performance


### Create a separate environment if needed

```bash
# Create a conda env with python_version>=3.10  (you could also use virtualenv)
conda create -n f5-tts python=3.10 --no-default-packages -y
conda activate f5-tts
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install PyTorch with matched device

<details>
<summary>NVIDIA GPU</summary>

> ```bash
> # Install pytorch with your CUDA version, e.g.
> pip install torch==2.4.0+cu124 torchaudio==2.4.0+cu124 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
> ```

</details>


### Runtime

Deployment solution with Triton and TensorRT-LLM.

#### Benchmark Results
Decoding on a single L20 GPU, using 26 different prompt_audio & target_text pairs, 16 NFE.

See [detailed instructions](src/f5_tts/runtime/triton_trtllm/README.md) for more information.


## Inference

- In order to achieve desired performance, take a moment to read [detailed guidance](src/f5_tts/infer).
- By properly searching the keywords of problem encountered, [issues](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS/issues?q=is%3Aissue) are very helpful.

### 1. Gradio App

Currently supported features:

- Basic TTS with Chunk Inference
- Multi-Style / Multi-Speaker Generation
- Voice Chat powered by Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
- [Custom inference with more language support](src/f5_tts/infer/SHARED.md)

```bash
# Launch a Gradio app (web interface)
f5-tts_infer-gradio

# Specify the port/host
f5-tts_infer-gradio --port 7860 --host 0.0.0.0

# Launch a share link
f5-tts_infer-gradio --share
```

## Training

### 1. With Hugging Face Accelerate

Refer to [training & finetuning guidance](src/f5_tts/train) for best practice.
